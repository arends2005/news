Now, here's what you need to do in the Discord Developer Portal:

1. Click on your "url-uploader" application
Go to the "Bot" section in the left sidebar
Scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents"
Enable these intents:
MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT
SERVER MEMBERS INTENT
PRESENCE INTENT

2. Go to your application's OAuth2 â†’ URL Generator
Under "Scopes" select:
bot
message.read
applications.commands
Under "Bot Permissions" select:
View Channels (under "General Permissions")
Send Messages (under "Text Permissions")
Add Reactions (under "Text Permissions")
Read Message History (under "Text Permissions")
Manage Messages (to delete messages)

DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/discord/callback

Let's rebuild the container with these updated intents:
